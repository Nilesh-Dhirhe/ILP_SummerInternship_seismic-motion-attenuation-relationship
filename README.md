# ILP_SummerInternship_seismic-motion-attenuation-relationship

## Project Description

This repository implements a machine learning framework for developing site-specific seismic ground motion attenuation models, leveraging over 275,000 strong motion records from the KiK-net database in Japan. Traditional Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) often fail to represent the non-linear and heterogeneous nature of seismic wave propagation across varying geological conditions. To overcome these limitations, we employ data-driven models using key seismological and geotechnical features, including moment magnitude, rupture distance, focal depth, Vs30, fault type, and tectonic regime, to predict peak ground acceleration (PGA). The framework evaluates four supervised learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks—under a standardized preprocessing pipeline with 3-fold cross-validation. Model performance is assessed using R², RMSE, and MAE, with XGBoost demonstrating the highest accuracy (R² = 0.64, MAE = 0.0463g), and DNN achieving robust generalization. SHAP-based explainability is incorporated to interpret feature contributions, confirming rupture distance and magnitude as primary drivers. Additionally, PGA classification into intensity bins (Low/Moderate/High) reveals strong precision for low-intensity events and highlights challenges with high-PGA predictions due to class imbalance. This work demonstrates the potential of ML-driven, interpretable attenuation models for advancing regional seismic hazard assessment and informing resilient infrastructure design.
